By Thomas Delage To run the db :

$bundle install to install ALL the gems
$rails db seed to initialize a database
$rails console to open the console ($rcif you're a hackerman)
Try $tp Doctor.all, $tp Patient.all, $tp Appointment.all to check if everything works (it does)(well it did yesterday at least)
